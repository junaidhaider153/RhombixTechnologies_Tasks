Student Grade Tracker – Python
This project is developed as a part of the Python Development Internship at Rhombix Technologies.

Description
A Python-based utility that automates the calculation of academic results. It collects marks for various subjects, computes the weighted percentage, and generates a formatted Student Grade Report with an assigned final grade.

Key Features
- Custom Subject Entries: Dynamically accepts any number of subjects.
- Automatic Grading: Uses conditional logic to assign grades (A, B, C, or Fail).
- Tabular Output: Displays a clean, structured summary of scores and percentages.

Concepts Used
- Dictionaries: For storing nested subject and score data.
- Loops & Control Flow: For iterative data entry and grade categorization.
- Input Handling: Casting user inputs into int and float for calculations.
- F-String Formatting: For precise alignment and decimal rounding in the final report.
