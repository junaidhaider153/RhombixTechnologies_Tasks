**Project Overview:**
This project is a console-based Memory Puzzle Game developed as part of the Python Development Internship at Rhombix Technologies.
The game challenges players to match pairs of shuffled cards within a set time limit. It enhances logical thinking, memory skills, and understanding of Python programming fundamentals.

**Objective:**
The objective of the game is to:
Match all pairs of cards
Complete the game within the given time limit
Avoid selecting invalid or already revealed cards

**Technologies & Concepts Used:**
This project demonstrates the use of:
Python Programming Language
Lists and List Manipulation
Loops (while loop)
Conditional Statements
Functions
Exception Handling
Random Module (for shuffling cards)
Time Module (for countdown timer)
Input Validation

**How the Game Works**
The game creates pairs of symbols.
Cards are shuffled randomly.
All cards are displayed face-down (*).
The player selects two card indexes.
If the symbols match:
Cards remain revealed.
If they do not match:
Cards flip back after 2 seconds.
The game ends when:
